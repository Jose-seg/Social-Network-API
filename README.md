# Social-Network-API

## Description
In this assignment, I created this backend app to test routes that can apply to a social network API, using lessons we learned
from class I was able to get routes to coincide with their associated routes. This assignment better helped me understand how
controllers connect with their routes. Even the use of postman made me realize how important it is to test routes with tools like these. Overall in the end I was able to better understand the purpose of the excercise and implement it in a personal project.

## Usage
This backend app is supposed to test the routes ive created to see if the associated controllers actually make their routes functional and that I was able to POST, PUT, DELETE, AND GET data. This is just the backend of a social network api but the implementation works as seen in the provided walkthrought.
